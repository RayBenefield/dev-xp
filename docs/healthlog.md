# Health Log

## #3

Took a standing shower.


## #2

Had an apple sauce to stave off breakfast.


## #1

Busy morning. Didn't get much today. I woke up with a set of stairs.


## #4

The lunch I had was a chef salad with some chili. Was delicious and simple.
Haven't had any water yet, but I should.


## #3

I felt horrid this morning. I ended up walking to get some food from our nearby
restaurant and so far that's been it. It's going to be a lax day today sadly.
But I'll pick it back up this weekend.


## #2

I was feeling hungry so I snagged an applesauce. The hunger is coming back, so I
need to grab something else. I need a light thing today, so I think I'm going to
go take a 30 min. stroll. I can't bring myself to do stairs so I am taking an
alternative. Maybe I'll go back to sleep and then try to walk.


## #1

Started the day with a standing shower. I also changed the way I'm numbering
these entries now. Instead of counting total of all time, I'm counting for the
day. It will help me keep a solid baseline. I'm not feeling well this morning...
I'm exhausted, tired, grumpy, and just generally in a bleh mood. Which sucks. I
think it is because I need to prioritize sleeping before 8. So I'm going to
start healing when I lay down earlier than 8. Not having the sleep is absolutely
killing my momentum.


## #11

Also had to walk to lunch yesterday so that was really good for me.


## #10

Had a salad for dinner with spinach, tomatoes, olives, cheese, oil, and apple
cider vinegar.


## #9

Finished a second water as well... never got to a third though. :(


## #8

Had steamed vegetables with my lunch today. Was made of brocolli, squash, and
carrots. Next time a double order of veggies will be better.


## #7

Had an apple while walking around. That was definitely good for me.


## #6

Ended up doing a second set of stairs. This time I actually jogged around half
of it and I'm quite happy about that. Was loads of difficult and it caused me to
have to use the rails, but it was good for me.


## #5

Just finished my first water and I think I'm going to do a set of stairs before
playing a bit of [**Monster Hunter World**](http://www.monsterhunterworld.com/)
before doing work today. Feeling good as I'm back to coding on [**Render
King**](https://github.com/RayBenefield/dev-xp/tree/master/src/node_modules/renderking).
:)


## #4

And finally took my vitamin C/D. Actually, I don't remember having that
yesterday. Oh well... yesterday was not normal routine so it's fine. Actually
downed it this morning with a green tea canada dry... great stuff if you haven't
tried it. Not sure if it has caffeine, but if it does, it is very little. Popped
open my first water and I'll report when that is finished.


## #3

Then I grabbed my usual apple for 5 mins worth of laps around the island to cool
down.


## #2

Then jumped right into doing stairs... today I decided I wanted to push it. I
went for a more brisk stair climbing. Normally I just focus on finishing, today
I put some force behind it. Trying to force a more aerobic exercise now. My
easiest time in life is always strength... I need to focus on my heart and lungs
and improving their capabilities so this is a good first step. I was able to
push hard for the first 5 minutes or so and then after that things got hard and
I had to result to the railing, but it's a start and a healthy start.


## #1

This morning though I started with a nice shower, standing of course. I felt
better this morning waking up then yesterday so that is good.


## #8

Also for dinner I had a salad and veggies and ranch. Alongside a hotdog and some
organic cheetos. Very happy about that. It was a lot of food, but was totally
worth it. The hotdog with ketchup and mustard was a really nice change of pace
and option with the handful of cheetos. I was able to really savor those while I
also enjoyed my salad and veggies. Was a fairly balanced dinner. So the hotdog
was better with cheddar... still... it was only one. lol...


## #7

Finished my one and only water yesterday... sad really. But I should be able to
catchup today (I'm writing this after the fact).


## #6

And finally Jess and I walked around Old Mill for a while which was good for my
legs. As the day dwindles down, I probably won't get much done, but I'm cool
with the day off as I get back to things tomorrow. Hopefully I won't feel so
dehydrated. 


## #5

For lunch I made a super healthy choice of getting a salad instead of french
fries. Which would have just been an easy slip up, but I changed it
appropriately.


## #4

I took a standing shower again... so that is good.


## #3

Also squeezed in a cinammon apple sauce which was actually pretty good. I
normally don't have applesauce.


## #2

I followed it up with an apple as per usual with light walking.


## #1

It is already late in the day, but its been busy because of Valentine's. I
started with a 10 min stairs. It was actually much harder this morning, I felt
drained and strangely woke up feeling completely dehydrated.


## #14

Finished my third water... off to a meetup for JS tonight.


## #13

Had some cafe yumm, basically rice, beans, salsa, sour cream, cheese, and
avocado all in a wrap. Delicious.


## #12

Finished my second water. YAY!!! Time to start my third.


## #11

Totally forgot that I did 5 perfect pushups earlier. :)


## #10

Also had a second apple after that and started on my second water. The fetching
of water is actually what triggered my stair walking... pretty stoked about it.
;) I'll report back probably with my lunch treats and the finishing of second
said water.


## #9

So I did a second set of stairs... seriously, my mind is blown how much easier
it is and how much more willing I am do to this over and over again. It just
gets easier and I'm still crazy sweaty, but it hasn't stopped me. So now I'm at
50 min walk + 20 min stairs... just because I felt like it. Not intended in the
slightest.


## #8

Just finished my first water and about to start my second. Already on a solid
track. :)


## #7

Following my usual apple I pulled out my first water and then downed my vitamin
C/D. And now I'm off to go do some paid work. It's 8 am and my body is ready. ;)
I should finish my first water fairly easily.


## #6

After my stairs, I did my usual routine... had an apple while I walked around
the kitchen island for 5 mins.


## #5

So this is weird... I had a sudden urge to do stairs as I walked towards the
kitchen... so I did. In addition to my 50 mins worth of walking, I squeezed in
some stairs. My body is really changing and it has only been 7 days. This whole
counting my "heals" has really done wonders for me. And it was 100% rail free
going upstairs, sometimes I would use it going down cuz I was bored lol... but
ultimately it was actually fairly easy and my body is getting used to it.


## #4

The walk back was even colder, cuz my jacket took the sweat from my first walk
and decided to make it colder... lol. And I also noticed on the way back that my
mustache was frozen from the condensation from breathing out of my nose. Holy
hell it was cold. But I did it. I even took pictures to prove it. :P Anyways,
now it is time to get some coding done. :) I'm satisfied with my current health
situation. Even if I've been slacking lately, it was cuz my mood was down and I
still pushed through. Good sign of things to come. And this log has been a
savior for keeping me sane and going. 64 is a magic number. ;) ONWARDS TO 128!!!


## #3

At Shari's I had a bunch of water and a mostly protein breakfast. 3 eggs,
T-bone, and toast with some apple juice and water. I had them not butter the
toast, and accidentally got a large apple juice and a small water, so next time
I'll be clear of that and switch the sizes. I had the third egg because I
swapped out my hashbrowns since I'm trying to avoid super fried foods as much as
possible. The steak and eggs and Shari's isn't too oily so I think ultimately
it'll work out... it is my guilty pleasure at the end of a 25 minute walk/jog
lol... and my muscles need the protein right? I don't know how health works
lol...


## #2

I broke something somewhere, cuz my heal count for the commits are one ahead of
my entries... lol. So I'm putting two entries there. So then after taking a
shower I decided to head out to Shari's this morning... a 25 min. walk. Note: It
was 15 degrees F when I left... damn cold. But I'm not going to let the cold
stop me from keeping my health. So I bundled up my jacket, setup my hood, grabbed my zip
gloves, and then headed out. Note also, I'm very stubborn and I hate long jeans,
so I wore shorts jeans on top of inside shorts. lol... so my poor shins suffered
a beating. In order to keep them warm... I had to stop every 5-10 mins to rub
them warm. Luckily I have these fancy zip away gloves to easily expose my hands.
But also I did some jogging on the way and that helped. So I'm back to doing
minor jogs... not just walking. :) Twas a good call.


## #1

A new day and I'm feeling in a much better mood. This morning I got up and
jumped into the shower, standing is not a problem anymore, but I'm recording it
so I don't revert. ;) So still counts for me. :P


## #8

Had a third water and calling it a night. Dinner was not healthy sadly. Slipping
on the diet, hopefully I turn things around tomorrow.


## #7

Had some veggies and ranch for a snack.


## #6

Had a second batch of water... about to start my third. My breakfast wasn't the
most healthy thing so I'm not reporting that. I'll have some veggies and ranch
in a sec though.


## #5

247.2... just weighed myself :). Hopefully it isn't just a water weight thing.
We shall see. I'm just finishing up my first water and I'm actually exhausted
and I'm going to go get some more sleep.


## #4

I followed that up with the taking of my vitamin C/D with some blueberry juice.
And now I'm working on my first water. I feel so out of it right now though.
Just really not in a great mood this morning. Bleh...


## #3

After stairs I grabbed an apple and ate it for 5 or so minutes while walking
around the kitchen island.


## #2

Followed by actually doing 10 mins of stairs... today was hard. Being drained
from last night and just not in the best of mood means that I really made an
accomplishment that I pushed though no matter how terrible I felt. Because I
don't have a choice... I already made the choice to be healthier, not I just
have an obligation/responsibility. That's how I'm viewing it.


## #1

Well I got food poisoning yesterday and was out of commission for the night so I
didn't get much "healing" done sadly. I had to sit in the shower and just bleh
for a half hour. Did not feel good. Good news is that even though I felt
iserable this morning I did everything anyway. Starting with a standing shower.


## #7

Finally I brisk walked the entire way home for an additional 25 minutes of
walking. So 50 minutes of brisk walking today. Feels good man. :) Gonna work on
my third water now.


## #6

I then had about enough water for a liter so I'm counting that as my second
water for the day.


## #5

Super proud of myself. I went on my brisk walk and decided to walk towards
Shari's... walked briskly on a timer for 15 minutes and then decided I was
already halfway there might as well keep going. So a 25 minute walk all the way
there.


## #4

Finished my first water of the day. Going on my walk now.


## #3

Finished up a bowl of cereal... not really a fan. It was Maple and Pecans...
maybe the other one I got will be better. Oh well. Working on my first water
while my phone charges and then I'll go on a 30 min walk.


## #2

Vitamin C/D consumed... I'm actually going to have a bowl of cereal instead. I
have options now that we went grocery shopping!!! YAY!!!


## #1

Took a standing shower this morning and had no need to sit down which is a good
sign that my leg strength is enough to hold my body for longer periods now with
little strain. Thank you stairs. I feel the most "stable" I've been in years,
not feeling like my body is too heavy and not slothing around anymore. I think
today I'm actually going to take a 30 min. walk instead of doing stairs. I think
that would be good for me. Let me legs play a little catch up while keeping some
sort of physical activity going. Time for an apple, some water, and my vitamins.


## #13

Yesterday I forgot to report that I finished a fourth water. WOOT!!! And it
looks like I reached 13 heals in a day. Good deal. The additional pushups were
definitely helpful. I need to keep those up as well. And I have more snacks
after our grocery run now so more apples for me to consume and more tomatoes and
salad stuffz. :) The habit should just get better. Shower time and a bit of
stretching. My leg muscles are still adapting, but they seem to be doing well. I
look forward to the time when they are not healing and stairs are just an
aerobic thing I'm trying to conquer.


## #12

Just finished my third water for the day... I'm going to try to grab a fourth
and finish it before the end of my [**Monster Hunter
World**](http://www.monsterhunterworld.com/) time.


## #11

Finished my second water for the day. I need to at least finish a third.
Probably won't be able to get through a 4th though.


## #10

Had a side salad along with my meatball sub... twas delicious. Still have some
veggies and ranch to be consumed later in the evening as I play [**Monster
Hunter World**](http://www.monsterhunterworld.com/). :)


## #9

Just got home from a bunch of errands and decided to due my third set of stairs.
Wasn't too bad at least and tomorrow will just be easier. Was really nice to
know that things are getting easier. In a day or two I might bump it up to
regularly 15 minute sessions instead.


## #8

Had an apple while strolling around our kitchen island while I cooled off from
the stairs. I also grabbed my second water and I should be able to down that and
a third today at least. My ideal would be to hit 4 again because I need to stay
really hydrated as I push through this.


## #7

Finished my second batch of stairs, almost completely rail-use-less. lol... but
I did it and my knees are feeling it a bit, but I'm hoping that in the next day
or two that pain will prove to actually be the new muscles that have to grow and
start pulling their weight. Hopefully... as the winter moves towards a close in
April, I should be able to switch to morning walks fairly easily. I still have
like a month and a half until then, but I should be able to do it. Hopefully I
nail down this routine though easily and keep going. Seems to be doing well so
far at least.


## #6

Finished my first water for the day. I also just weighted myself at 249.2 which
isn't much of a change still. But I'll survive. I can blame it on muscle as I am
building quite a bit of that with stairs. I'm actually going to go do a second
set now. Since I decided that I don't want to do programming this morning. I
kind of want to play some [**Monster Hunter
World**](http://www.monsterhunterworld.com/). So I'll earn that with a second
set of stairs.


## #5

Did another set of 5 perfect pushups. While waiting for my build to pass.


## #4

Also spontaneously I felt like I needed to start doing push ups. So I'm starting
with 5 perfect pushups. And I'll try to use that throughout the day to build
some strength and more healthy habits. Gotta hit my minimum 10 a day at least
now that I've established a pseudo average. Actually the average is 11 1/3...
but I like even numbers :P. Perhaps 10 will get easy when I do pushups regularly
and I will be able to bump it to 15 instead.


## #3

Forgot to record my shower as well. Didn't have to stretch too much this morning
since my legs were good. Was just trying to solve a programming problem. But
that is good news. That means my body feels comfortable enough physically to
solve problems mentally. Generally a physical ailment will prevent my brain from
being able to focus. So this is a good sign.


## #2

Also downed my vitamin c&d today. Started up a fresh water and I'm ready to jump
into coding. Jess luckily has blueberry juice that I'm able to use now to make
taking the vitamin c powder easier. It isn't the best taste in my mouth. Gotta
keep working on my health. I'm doing good, diet is the hardest and habit is the
hardest, so I just have to keep doing. For habit, just keep persisting. No
matter how little I do, build the habit first just do it. Quality doesn't need
to be focused on yet. At least I have the habit to stand in the shower now and
then follow it up immediately with stairs.


## #1

Alright did my first set of stairs today. It was only 10 minutes and the soar in
my legs are pretty much all gone. So this time I focused on muscle strength
rather than persistence. I avoided using the rails for like 80% of the time. And
focused on my leg muscles pushing me up rather than relying on my joints to do
the work. Trying to avoid knee problems. It seemed to work well. From an aerobic
perspective though I'm still having a hard time. Cardio was always my worst
enemy so I need to focus on the muscle building right now to lessen the effort
of carrying my body in general. 250 pounds is no easy feat so I have to try to
make that easier. I had a hard enough time in the military with terrible shin
splints, so I can try to find better ways to build my lung capabilities over
time. I need to focus muscular for now because that has always been my strength
when I exercise.


## #9

Also finished up a third water. I didn't get very many heals yesterday. But I
was distracted. Sounds like my minimum number of heals a day I should shoot for
is probably around 10-ish. I had 12 the first two days and 9 yesterday. It is
the morning and my legs feel really strong today with minor pain now. I still
have to limp a little bit, but I should be good to go on stairs for sure. Just
need to do it. At least yesterday I did a 15 minute session rather than a 10.


## #8

For dinner I had a salad and veggies and ranch. Also had some crackers with
pistachio butter, but then I ahd an allergic reaction to something. It was
weird.


## #7

Finished up my second water. At least one more to go. I might actually hit the
stairs in an hour too after work.


## #6

Also downed my vitamin c that I forgot to take this morning, and also downed
vitamin d since Jess finally pointed out where it was... I apparently got lazy
and stopped looking right before I got to the vitamin d bottle lol... don't
judge me.


## #5

Walked to the restaurant today for some food. Not the healthiest of things. Just
a french dip and clam chowder with a house salad and veggies and ranch for
later. But I'll report on the house salad and veggies and ranch when they are
consumed.


## #4

Finished my first water of the day. Time to start a second one... and it is
getting easier and easier to walk. I'll probably do my second stairs in the next
few hours. Probably around lunch time. I'm getting hungry so probably bagel time
for me.


## #3

WOOT!!!! So I did my stairs, but today it felt easier than the other times... so
much so that I added an additional 5 minutes to the 10 minute timer after the 10
minutes. So I felt good enough to keep going for another 5 minutes. WOOT!!! That
helps keep me motivated... only my 5th set of stairs and I'm already feeling so
much stronger and better than I have been in years. And I have sooo much sweat
dripping down me right now... I'm an unnaturally sweety person lol. But who
cares, I'm in my own home that I am fortunate to own as part of my privilege and
situation. I'm lucky to have that and I hate that most people don't get the same
opportunity. <3 I was thinking this whole time that part of what keeps me going
is being able to accept the small wins as wins. And I have the opportunity to do
that when I track more details. The more details I have the more places I can
find SOMETHING that will keep me going. This log has helped a lot for my own
tracking purposes, because even just writing it down helps me. Knowing I've been
having a salad at least once a day, sometimes twice. Knowing that I had 4 waters
yesterday rather than my usual max of 3. Knowing that I'm walking and doing
stairs and yes it is hard, but that makes me human. Nothing comes easy... you
just gotta keep pushing. Cracked open my first water of the day and I'll report
back when it is done. I'll probably weigh myself in too for more tiny details.
TO CODING!!!


## #2

I had "black hole" stomach this morning and was starving. Looked around for a
snack and found a stash of Jess' apples and had one while I walked around the
island. It was delicious... and I don't normally eat apples cuz I'm too lazy to
handle the skin... lol. Don't judge me. About to start my first set of stairs.
:) Then into coding.


## #1

Started off the morning with a solid shower and used it for stretching. At first
my legs were ridiculously in pain after sleeping, but with some stretching it
actually feels solid to walk around. I should be able to do 2-3 stairs today
instead of one easily. :) I actually feel more stable than I have in a while
standing wise and it doesn't hurt... amazing that only two days of stairs can do
that.


## #11

Had dinner consisting of that salad, clam chowder, and veggies and ranch. Was
good. I'm really missing real food though. :( Oh well. Bed time for me.


## #10

Walked to food today for delicious salad, clam chowder, and veggies and ranch.
Hurt like hell, but easier than expected. I should be able to get fully back
into stair tomorrow... as long as my legs hold up. While my legs get accustomed,
I don't think a full 3 is feasible without tearing muscles.


## #9

Finished my 4th water... heading out to go grab some dinner.


## #8

Had jimmy john's for lunch... was delicious. Gotta start my 4th water for the
day... perhaps I can get a 5th in tonight.


## #7

Just finished my third water... and about to get lunch. I can barely walk so
Jimmy John's it is... lol.


## #6

Had a quick bagel to hold me over until lunch. Trying to avoid grabbing a snack
in the next two hours before lunch time. And just starting my third water too.


## #5

Finished my second water for the day and going to grab a third. I also ended up
taking up the damn trash bins... which was a pain with my ridiculously stiff
legs. SOOO much pain. Also just weighed myself at 250.0 flat... so it is only
really day two, we shall see how things look on week two. Gonna grab a bagel
now. I'm starving and can't wait until lunch.


## #4

Just finished my first water of the day. Off to grab a second. I'll probably
snag a bagel at some point too so I can survive to lunch.


## #3

Just took my vitamin c for the day... I think I'm going to need to start taking
vitamin d as well since I stay indoors most my life. The vitamin d should help
with my motivation and general mood and attitude as I shoot to improve
everything. I've also got some water that I didn't finish yesterday, but I will
count it today, cuz finishing the total is what matters. So I should finish that
soon. Back to coding.


## #2

Fucking stairs man... I swear the second day is ALWAYS the hardest when you
restart excersizing. Your muscles tightening and it hurting like hell to walk
results in a lot of failures... but not me today. I'm going to get through the
next two as well. And hopefully tomorrow is a little easier. Continued hydration
should help me make this consistent as well. The first couple weeks. I need to
get through those consistently and then I should be able to keep this all up.
That was ridiculously exhausting.


## #1

This morning I started my day with a standing 15 min shower. Which is awesome...
and impressive considering how sore my legs are from yesterday's stairs. It gave
me the opportunity to stretch my legs out in preparation for doing more stairs
today. Quite proud. I should probably start drinking water and everything before
I forget. And vitamin C, that would be good too. Gotta do my first set of stairs
soon.


## #13

Forgot to report last night that I had a salad and veggies and ranch for dinner.
Also had some organic white cheddar cheetos that actually seemed very pure... it
was pretty awesome.


## #12

Alright I completed my third set of stairs for the day. 12 heals in a day seems
solid. I think I might get one more by downing one more water. I'm exhausted and
ready to go to bed for the day. I'm not looking forward to the soar muscles
tomorrow from the workouts done today... even though it wasn't much, it was a
lot for me.


## #11

So I finally finished my third water. It is late in the day, but it is done. I
might try for one more bottle. I typically don't go over 3, but I really should
today. And that lunch has filled me so I haven't really needed to snack at all
which is good. I should go on a walk though and I still haven't finished my
third stairs yet. I guess I can do that after work in 30 minutes.


## #10

Haven't finished my third water yet, but I walked to the Backyard with Jess and
grabbed a garden sandwitch with chicken... it was delicious and full of veggies.
Not sometihng I'll have often, but a good option when necessary. I'll report
back when I finish my water, and sometime today I need to do my third set of
stairs.


## #9

AHHH!!! Fucking stairs man... they are exhausting... even though it was only 10
minutes. I'll get over it soon I hope. Perhaps after a week or two I can bump it
to 15  minutes for each session. Man I'm dying... but not really which is good.
Grabbed my 3rd 1 liter smart water so I'll report that when it is done. Time for
paid work now. Bleh! Proud of myself though. 9 Heals in a single day... good
stuff.


## #8

Finished my second liter of smart water, which is good and I'll need to start a
third. Before I do that though I'm going to jump onto the 10 mins of stairs.
This ought to be fun... lol. Here we go.


## #7

So I have taken a walk to get hot chocolate... normally I would get a caramel
latte, but instead I need to cut out the caffeine in my life too, because I tend
to suffer a LOT from caffeine withdrawals so I need to cut that out as well.
Gotta maximize my health. Sure sugar isn't the best for weight, but I'm using it
to compensate for cutting out fried foods from my diet completely and heavy
salts. So things should keep going smoothly. Still gotta finish this second
liter of smart water too and I think I might be due for another batch of stairs.


## #6

So I didn't grab a bagel... I actually went bold and decided to grab some of
Jess' super greens... chard and spinach and what not tossed in a bit of parmesan
shredded cheese, grape tomatoes, olive oil, and apple cider vinegar... it is
actually pretty good. :) Definitely a win. :)


## #5

Alright a 5-ish minute walk between work sessions is now done. :) Wasn't too
bad. The cold is alright, at least it isn't icey. Also took a quick weight check
for recording purposes. I weigh in at 249.4 pounds. So I have a long way to go.
I think really long term I'd really like to be about 180. I think that is a
solid weight for me and I'm going to ultimately shoot for that. But every pound
will make a difference for motivation sake. Same that every 25 minute work
session keeps me going. I also grabbed some grape tomatoes as snacks as I pass
by them. So more grape tomatoes in the house would be good for my snacking
purposes. I'll probably snag a bagel for breakfast rather than skip or order
something unhealthy... as delicious as it sounds. But the bagel is faster and
healthier... even with all the cream cheese. I'll justify it as I need to for
now. :P It is about building the habit first and dropping the bad ones. It
doesn't have to be perfect quite yet. Also I'll never go vegan... I can't not
have cheese. Sorry folks. :P Back to work... need to grab a bagel first though.


## #4

Just finished my 1 liter smart water while doing a coding session. I think I'm
going to head out on a walk now since it helps clear my brain and I used to take
walks in between sessions while it wasn't cold. I'm just gonna suck it up.


## #3

Alright vitamin c dose consumed... funny story. I'm actually allergic to citrus.
And I haven't really eaten much vegetables. So vitamin c is really hard to come
by for me. I'm also have ADD so I have a hard time remembering to take medicine.
So I'm going to use this opportunity to build the habit. I cracked open a 1
liter smart water so I'll log that when it is done.


## #2

Alright... holy shit... first stairs done. When you are as heavy and lazy as
me... that 10 minutes is a nightmare. But only the first is the worst. I can do
this. That is one thing down. So many to go. I'd like to at least do 30 minutes
of moderate level of physical activity and 10 minutes of stairs is good for now.
I can do a bit at a time between work. Good that hurt and I can taste my phlem
all over again. Is that how you spell it? lol... alright gonna go take some
vitamin c for another log and then I'll finish a water for another one. ARGH!!!
I will fucking fight... damn it. And no heart attack yet. That is a positive.


## #1

Today I'm changing everything. Over the past few weeks I have had a lot of aches
and pains that hint at something along the lines of a heart attack or stroke.
I'm only 29... I shouldn't have this at all. I'm 5' 6" and 250 lbs....
ridiculously overweight. And up until now I was ok with being just happy. But if
I'm going to succeed... if I'm going to achieve my goals and reach my dreams, I
need to change. My original plans for my DEX methodology was not just about pure
work efficiency, but also about using health as a way to enhance productivity
and baking that into the system to improve not just the development agility, but
the longevity and the efficiency. A healthier body leads to a healthier mind as
a result and I should be able to maximize my output if I take my health into
account. I have failed to do that. I focused on just the work side for the past
year, but now it's time to change that.

When I first started this process of logging my work, I walked... all the time.
Then the winter came and I used the cold as an excuse to not have to walk. "I'll
do it when the winter is over". Yeah, that's just an excuse and I'm ashamed I
did it. So now I'm fixing that. Yesterday we had to go to Urgent Care... the
past few weeks have given me several scares. Enough that a couple days ago I
told myself I'd fix my diet first. But this morning, it is abundantly clear that
that will not be enough. I need to do more. So I'm working on this system.

The idea is that I now have a "heal" script. Like my worklog where I type `log`
and track what I did for work in those 25 minutes of work. Now I will type
`heal` whenever I do anything that propels my health forward. A lazy habit
overcome, healthy food I ate, drinking water even. Anything that helps propel me
forward. This log is not going to be based on time, but quantity. Padding the
numbers is something that I want. Because every little step helps. And logging
is a HUGE thing for me. I always liked blogging, but always wanted structure to
my posts. Worklogs have got me just in the habit of doing things. So now I'm
building this habit of tracking my health approach. It won't be an official food
diary where I can track statistics right now, but the habit forming goal of just
"healing" is important. Instead of tracking "sessions", I will be tracking
"apples" instead. Because an apple away will keep the doctor's away, but that
doesn't mean you won't die in the process. So I want more than just an apple a
day... I want as many as I can fucking push for. Build the better habits and get
a better life... it's time to do that.

Starting with the first... so this is embarrassing, but whatever. I don't stand
in showers... like I like showers, but I sit on the floor and just enjoy the
sort of raining feeling. I'll sit there for too long... typically 30 minutes,
sometimes an hour or longer. I use it as my thinking time and it has made me
lazy. I've been doing it for years... like LOTS of years. So I'm fixing that.
This morning I stood in the shower instead of sat down. Which is small, but
still every little bit counts. So I'm counting this. Padding the numbers is good
in terms of health. Just keep adding. Oh and I only stood for 15 minutes, so
bonus I will actually be gaining a lot of time in my day by doing this. I use
this technique in the shower where I put the fan on for the 30 minute timer to
at least know when 30 mins have passed. Typically I just end up ignoring it, cuz
I'm too lazy to stand up. But now that I am already standing, I'm relieved to
hear the fans turn off after 15 minutes, cuz it means I don't have to stand
there anymore and that relief should be able to help me propel forward and do it
more. Some happiness juice for my brain to build the habit.

All of this work is also going to be in my "company" monorepo. It will be part
of my work as much as it is part of my life. I have to make the change, or I'm
not gonna live long enough to prove the world that I can be awesome. Sure it is
a bit prideful, but fuck the haters, I'm gonna take my life in my own hands. I'm
going to go do 10 minutes of stairs now and several times throughout the day. :P
Then I'll get to some real work after those stairs. Oh and I can drink some
water too. ;)
