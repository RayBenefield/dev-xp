# Health Log

## #39

Finished my first water for the day. I also just weighted myself at 249.2 which
isn't much of a change still. But I'll survive. I can blame it on muscle as I am
building quite a bit of that with stairs. I'm actually going to go do a second
set now. Since I decided that I don't want to do programming this morning. I
kind of want to play some [**Monster Hunter
World**](http://www.monsterhunterworld.com/). So I'll earn that with a second
set of stairs.


## #38

Did another set of 5 perfect pushups. While waiting for my build to pass.


## #37

Also spontaneously I felt like I needed to start doing push ups. So I'm starting
with 5 perfect pushups. And I'll try to use that throughout the day to build
some strength and more healthy habits. Gotta hit my minimum 10 a day at least
now that I've established a pseudo average. Actually the average is 11 1/3...
but I like even numbers :P. Perhaps 10 will get easy when I do pushups regularly
and I will be able to bump it to 15 instead.


## #36

Forgot to record my shower as well. Didn't have to stretch too much this morning
since my legs were good. Was just trying to solve a programming problem. But
that is good news. That means my body feels comfortable enough physically to
solve problems mentally. Generally a physical ailment will prevent my brain from
being able to focus. So this is a good sign.


## #35

Also downed my vitamin c&d today. Started up a fresh water and I'm ready to jump
into coding. Jess luckily has blueberry juice that I'm able to use now to make
taking the vitamin c powder easier. It isn't the best taste in my mouth. Gotta
keep working on my health. I'm doing good, diet is the hardest and habit is the
hardest, so I just have to keep doing. For habit, just keep persisting. No
matter how little I do, build the habit first just do it. Quality doesn't need
to be focused on yet. At least I have the habit to stand in the shower now and
then follow it up immediately with stairs.


## #34

Alright did my first set of stairs today. It was only 10 minutes and the soar in
my legs are pretty much all gone. So this time I focused on muscle strength
rather than persistence. I avoided using the rails for like 80% of the time. And
focused on my leg muscles pushing me up rather than relying on my joints to do
the work. Trying to avoid knee problems. It seemed to work well. From an aerobic
perspective though I'm still having a hard time. Cardio was always my worst
enemy so I need to focus on the muscle building right now to lessen the effort
of carrying my body in general. 250 pounds is no easy feat so I have to try to
make that easier. I had a hard enough time in the military with terrible shin
splints, so I can try to find better ways to build my lung capabilities over
time. I need to focus muscular for now because that has always been my strength
when I exercise.


## #33

Also finished up a third water. I didn't get very many heals yesterday. But I
was distracted. Sounds like my minimum number of heals a day I should shoot for
is probably around 10-ish. I had 12 the first two days and 9 yesterday. It is
the morning and my legs feel really strong today with minor pain now. I still
have to limp a little bit, but I should be good to go on stairs for sure. Just
need to do it. At least yesterday I did a 15 minute session rather than a 10.


## #32

For dinner I had a salad and veggies and ranch. Also had some crackers with
pistachio butter, but then I ahd an allergic reaction to something. It was
weird.


## #31

Finished up my second water. At least one more to go. I might actually hit the
stairs in an hour too after work.


## #30

Also downed my vitamin c that I forgot to take this morning, and also downed
vitamin d since Jess finally pointed out where it was... I apparently got lazy
and stopped looking right before I got to the vitamin d bottle lol... don't
judge me.


## #29

Walked to the restaurant today for some food. Not the healthiest of things. Just
a french dip and clam chowder with a house salad and veggies and ranch for
later. But I'll report on the house salad and veggies and ranch when they are
consumed.


## #28

Finished my first water of the day. Time to start a second one... and it is
getting easier and easier to walk. I'll probably do my second stairs in the next
few hours. Probably around lunch time. I'm getting hungry so probably bagel time
for me.


## #27

WOOT!!!! So I did my stairs, but today it felt easier than the other times... so
much so that I added an additional 5 minutes to the 10 minute timer after the 10
minutes. So I felt good enough to keep going for another 5 minutes. WOOT!!! That
helps keep me motivated... only my 5th set of stairs and I'm already feeling so
much stronger and better than I have been in years. And I have sooo much sweat
dripping down me right now... I'm an unnaturally sweety person lol. But who
cares, I'm in my own home that I am fortunate to own as part of my privilege and
situation. I'm lucky to have that and I hate that most people don't get the same
opportunity. <3 I was thinking this whole time that part of what keeps me going
is being able to accept the small wins as wins. And I have the opportunity to do
that when I track more details. The more details I have the more places I can
find SOMETHING that will keep me going. This log has helped a lot for my own
tracking purposes, because even just writing it down helps me. Knowing I've been
having a salad at least once a day, sometimes twice. Knowing that I had 4 waters
yesterday rather than my usual max of 3. Knowing that I'm walking and doing
stairs and yes it is hard, but that makes me human. Nothing comes easy... you
just gotta keep pushing. Cracked open my first water of the day and I'll report
back when it is done. I'll probably weigh myself in too for more tiny details.
TO CODING!!!


## #26

I had "black hole" stomach this morning and was starving. Looked around for a
snack and found a stash of Jess' apples and had one while I walked around the
island. It was delicious... and I don't normally eat apples cuz I'm too lazy to
handle the skin... lol. Don't judge me. About to start my first set of stairs.
:) Then into coding.


## #25

Started off the morning with a solid shower and used it for stretching. At first
my legs were ridiculously in pain after sleeping, but with some stretching it
actually feels solid to walk around. I should be able to do 2-3 stairs today
instead of one easily. :) I actually feel more stable than I have in a while
standing wise and it doesn't hurt... amazing that only two days of stairs can do
that.


## #24

Had dinner consisting of that salad, clam chowder, and veggies and ranch. Was
good. I'm really missing real food though. :( Oh well. Bed time for me.


## #23

Walked to food today for delicious salad, clam chowder, and veggies and ranch.
Hurt like hell, but easier than expected. I should be able to get fully back
into stair tomorrow... as long as my legs hold up. While my legs get accustomed,
I don't think a full 3 is feasible without tearing muscles.


## #22

Finished my 4th water... heading out to go grab some dinner.


## #21

Had jimmy john's for lunch... was delicious. Gotta start my 4th water for the
day... perhaps I can get a 5th in tonight.


## #20

Just finished my third water... and about to get lunch. I can barely walk so
Jimmy John's it is... lol.


## #19

Had a quick bagel to hold me over until lunch. Trying to avoid grabbing a snack
in the next two hours before lunch time. And just starting my third water too.


## #18

Finished my second water for the day and going to grab a third. I also ended up
taking up the damn trash bins... which was a pain with my ridiculously stiff
legs. SOOO much pain. Also just weighed myself at 250.0 flat... so it is only
really day two, we shall see how things look on week two. Gonna grab a bagel
now. I'm starving and can't wait until lunch.


## #17

Just finished my first water of the day. Off to grab a second. I'll probably
snag a bagel at some point too so I can survive to lunch.


## #16

Just took my vitamin c for the day... I think I'm going to need to start taking
vitamin d as well since I stay indoors most my life. The vitamin d should help
with my motivation and general mood and attitude as I shoot to improve
everything. I've also got some water that I didn't finish yesterday, but I will
count it today, cuz finishing the total is what matters. So I should finish that
soon. Back to coding.


## #15

Fucking stairs man... I swear the second day is ALWAYS the hardest when you
restart excersizing. Your muscles tightening and it hurting like hell to walk
results in a lot of failures... but not me today. I'm going to get through the
next two as well. And hopefully tomorrow is a little easier. Continued hydration
should help me make this consistent as well. The first couple weeks. I need to
get through those consistently and then I should be able to keep this all up.
That was ridiculously exhausting.


## #14

This morning I started my day with a standing 15 min shower. Which is awesome...
and impressive considering how sore my legs are from yesterday's stairs. It gave
me the opportunity to stretch my legs out in preparation for doing more stairs
today. Quite proud. I should probably start drinking water and everything before
I forget. And vitamin C, that would be good too. Gotta do my first set of stairs
soon.


## #13

Forgot to report last night that I had a salad and veggies and ranch for dinner.
Also had some organic white cheddar cheetos that actually seemed very pure... it
was pretty awesome.


## #12

Alright I completed my third set of stairs for the day. 12 heals in a day seems
solid. I think I might get one more by downing one more water. I'm exhausted and
ready to go to bed for the day. I'm not looking forward to the soar muscles
tomorrow from the workouts done today... even though it wasn't much, it was a
lot for me.


## #11

So I finally finished my third water. It is late in the day, but it is done. I
might try for one more bottle. I typically don't go over 3, but I really should
today. And that lunch has filled me so I haven't really needed to snack at all
which is good. I should go on a walk though and I still haven't finished my
third stairs yet. I guess I can do that after work in 30 minutes.


## #10

Haven't finished my third water yet, but I walked to the Backyard with Jess and
grabbed a garden sandwitch with chicken... it was delicious and full of veggies.
Not sometihng I'll have often, but a good option when necessary. I'll report
back when I finish my water, and sometime today I need to do my third set of
stairs.


## #9

AHHH!!! Fucking stairs man... they are exhausting... even though it was only 10
minutes. I'll get over it soon I hope. Perhaps after a week or two I can bump it
to 15  minutes for each session. Man I'm dying... but not really which is good.
Grabbed my 3rd 1 liter smart water so I'll report that when it is done. Time for
paid work now. Bleh! Proud of myself though. 9 Heals in a single day... good
stuff.


## #8

Finished my second liter of smart water, which is good and I'll need to start a
third. Before I do that though I'm going to jump onto the 10 mins of stairs.
This ought to be fun... lol. Here we go.


## #7

So I have taken a walk to get hot chocolate... normally I would get a caramel
latte, but instead I need to cut out the caffeine in my life too, because I tend
to suffer a LOT from caffeine withdrawals so I need to cut that out as well.
Gotta maximize my health. Sure sugar isn't the best for weight, but I'm using it
to compensate for cutting out fried foods from my diet completely and heavy
salts. So things should keep going smoothly. Still gotta finish this second
liter of smart water too and I think I might be due for another batch of stairs.


## #6

So I didn't grab a bagel... I actually went bold and decided to grab some of
Jess' super greens... chard and spinach and what not tossed in a bit of parmesan
shredded cheese, grape tomatoes, olive oil, and apple cider vinegar... it is
actually pretty good. :) Definitely a win. :)


## #5

Alright a 5-ish minute walk between work sessions is now done. :) Wasn't too
bad. The cold is alright, at least it isn't icey. Also took a quick weight check
for recording purposes. I weigh in at 249.4 pounds. So I have a long way to go.
I think really long term I'd really like to be about 180. I think that is a
solid weight for me and I'm going to ultimately shoot for that. But every pound
will make a difference for motivation sake. Same that every 25 minute work
session keeps me going. I also grabbed some grape tomatoes as snacks as I pass
by them. So more grape tomatoes in the house would be good for my snacking
purposes. I'll probably snag a bagel for breakfast rather than skip or order
something unhealthy... as delicious as it sounds. But the bagel is faster and
healthier... even with all the cream cheese. I'll justify it as I need to for
now. :P It is about building the habit first and dropping the bad ones. It
doesn't have to be perfect quite yet. Also I'll never go vegan... I can't not
have cheese. Sorry folks. :P Back to work... need to grab a bagel first though.


## #4

Just finished my 1 liter smart water while doing a coding session. I think I'm
going to head out on a walk now since it helps clear my brain and I used to take
walks in between sessions while it wasn't cold. I'm just gonna suck it up.


## #3

Alright vitamin c dose consumed... funny story. I'm actually allergic to citrus.
And I haven't really eaten much vegetables. So vitamin c is really hard to come
by for me. I'm also have ADD so I have a hard time remembering to take medicine.
So I'm going to use this opportunity to build the habit. I cracked open a 1
liter smart water so I'll log that when it is done.


## #2

Alright... holy shit... first stairs done. When you are as heavy and lazy as
me... that 10 minutes is a nightmare. But only the first is the worst. I can do
this. That is one thing down. So many to go. I'd like to at least do 30 minutes
of moderate level of physical activity and 10 minutes of stairs is good for now.
I can do a bit at a time between work. Good that hurt and I can taste my phlem
all over again. Is that how you spell it? lol... alright gonna go take some
vitamin c for another log and then I'll finish a water for another one. ARGH!!!
I will fucking fight... damn it. And no heart attack yet. That is a positive.


## #1

Today I'm changing everything. Over the past few weeks I have had a lot of aches
and pains that hint at something along the lines of a heart attack or stroke.
I'm only 29... I shouldn't have this at all. I'm 5' 6" and 250 lbs....
ridiculously overweight. And up until now I was ok with being just happy. But if
I'm going to succeed... if I'm going to achieve my goals and reach my dreams, I
need to change. My original plans for my DEX methodology was not just about pure
work efficiency, but also about using health as a way to enhance productivity
and baking that into the system to improve not just the development agility, but
the longevity and the efficiency. A healthier body leads to a healthier mind as
a result and I should be able to maximize my output if I take my health into
account. I have failed to do that. I focused on just the work side for the past
year, but now it's time to change that.

When I first started this process of logging my work, I walked... all the time.
Then the winter came and I used the cold as an excuse to not have to walk. "I'll
do it when the winter is over". Yeah, that's just an excuse and I'm ashamed I
did it. So now I'm fixing that. Yesterday we had to go to Urgent Care... the
past few weeks have given me several scares. Enough that a couple days ago I
told myself I'd fix my diet first. But this morning, it is abundantly clear that
that will not be enough. I need to do more. So I'm working on this system.

The idea is that I now have a "heal" script. Like my worklog where I type `log`
and track what I did for work in those 25 minutes of work. Now I will type
`heal` whenever I do anything that propels my health forward. A lazy habit
overcome, healthy food I ate, drinking water even. Anything that helps propel me
forward. This log is not going to be based on time, but quantity. Padding the
numbers is something that I want. Because every little step helps. And logging
is a HUGE thing for me. I always liked blogging, but always wanted structure to
my posts. Worklogs have got me just in the habit of doing things. So now I'm
building this habit of tracking my health approach. It won't be an official food
diary where I can track statistics right now, but the habit forming goal of just
"healing" is important. Instead of tracking "sessions", I will be tracking
"apples" instead. Because an apple away will keep the doctor's away, but that
doesn't mean you won't die in the process. So I want more than just an apple a
day... I want as many as I can fucking push for. Build the better habits and get
a better life... it's time to do that.

Starting with the first... so this is embarrassing, but whatever. I don't stand
in showers... like I like showers, but I sit on the floor and just enjoy the
sort of raining feeling. I'll sit there for too long... typically 30 minutes,
sometimes an hour or longer. I use it as my thinking time and it has made me
lazy. I've been doing it for years... like LOTS of years. So I'm fixing that.
This morning I stood in the shower instead of sat down. Which is small, but
still every little bit counts. So I'm counting this. Padding the numbers is good
in terms of health. Just keep adding. Oh and I only stood for 15 minutes, so
bonus I will actually be gaining a lot of time in my day by doing this. I use
this technique in the shower where I put the fan on for the 30 minute timer to
at least know when 30 mins have passed. Typically I just end up ignoring it, cuz
I'm too lazy to stand up. But now that I am already standing, I'm relieved to
hear the fans turn off after 15 minutes, cuz it means I don't have to stand
there anymore and that relief should be able to help me propel forward and do it
more. Some happiness juice for my brain to build the habit.

All of this work is also going to be in my "company" monorepo. It will be part
of my work as much as it is part of my life. I have to make the change, or I'm
not gonna live long enough to prove the world that I can be awesome. Sure it is
a bit prideful, but fuck the haters, I'm gonna take my life in my own hands. I'm
going to go do 10 minutes of stairs now and several times throughout the day. :P
Then I'll get to some real work after those stairs. Oh and I can drink some
water too. ;)
