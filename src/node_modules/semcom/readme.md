# SemCom

[**SemCom**](https://github.com/RayBenefield/kikd/tree/master/src/node_modules/semcom)
stands for **Semantic Commits** and is built around on 99% of [**Semantic
Versioning**](https://semver.org/). It is inspired by [**Conventional
Commits**](https://conventionalcommits.org/) and seeks to provide a standard and
a full toolset around a commit message style. It is more specific than
[**Conventional Commits**](https://conventionalcommits.org/) and will attempt to
cover a company monorepo that consists of many projects. It will provide tools
similar to the [**Conventional Commits**](https://conventionalcommits.org/)
toolset: auto-versioning, generate changelogs, commit validation, commit
generation, etc.
